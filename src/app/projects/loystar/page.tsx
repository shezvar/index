              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
              Running a small business often means juggling multiple tools and processes: managing sales, customer loyalty, and order fulfillment. Small businesses face challenges with fragmented tools that don&lsquo;t communicate well with each other, complex loyalty programs that require significant effort to set up, and a lack of actionable insights from their data.
              </p>
              <p>
              Many business owners, especially those in retail or food services, also need to manage appointments, bundled products, and complex payment scenariosâ€”but existing platforms don&lsquo;t provide an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution. Loystar was born out of the need to simplify and centralize these business operations into a single, intuitive platform.
              </p>
              <p>
              As the Product Designer, I was tasked with creating the UI/UX design for the Loystar platform, focusing on a unified dashboard that simplifies sales, loyalty management, and provides actionable insights.

              <p>
              Small business owners face significant challenges with fragmented tools and complex systems. They need a unified platform that can handle sales, customer loyalty, and analytics in one place, while being powerful enough to provide deep insights but simple enough for users with limited time and technical expertise.

                <li>Lack of actionable insights from business data</li>
                <li>Need for flexible payment methods (cash, contactless, gift cards, loyalty points)</li>
